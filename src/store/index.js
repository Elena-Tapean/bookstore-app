In general, it is more plot-driven than character-driven, with narratives that tend to be distinct and easily understandable. <br/> One of its most important characteristics is that its stories can be classified into a specific literary genre. As such, they use themes, tropes, techniques, styles, and tones that set them apart from stories in other genres. <br/> Examples of popular general fiction genres include thriller, fantasy, science fiction, crime, horror, and romance. Because of this, general fiction reaches a broad range of audiences that primarily read it for entertainment. Not only is this fiction easy to get into, but readers can quickly immerse themselves into a story through familiar genre elements.'

There\'s more focus on the style and characterization, with its audience reading for its artistry and depth rather than just for entertainment. <br/> Literary fiction often takes on grand or complicated subjects such as philosophical musings, social issues, and political arguments. <br/> This, combined with its writing styles and frequent experimentation of literary forms, can make it somewhat difficult to digest and classify into any genre.'
