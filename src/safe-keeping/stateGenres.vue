        description: '<p style="margin: 0 30px; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; line-height: 2;"> General Fiction (also known as Commercial fiction, Mainstream fiction, and Popular fiction) is one of the two main categories of fiction. In general, it is more plot-driven than character-driven, with narratives that tend to be distinct and easily understandable. <br> <p style="margin: 0 30px; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; line-height: 2;"> One of its most important characteristics is that its stories can be classified into a specific literary genre. As such, they use themes, tropes, techniques, styles, and tones that set them apart from stories in other genres. <br> <p style="margin: 0 30px; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; line-height: 2;"> Examples of popular general fiction genres include thriller, fantasy, science fiction, crime, horror, and romance. Because of this, general fiction reaches a broad range of audiences that primarily read it for entertainment. Not only is this fiction easy to get into, but readers can quickly immerse themselves into a story through familiar genre elements.</p>'

        description: '<p style="margin: 0 30px; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; line-height: 2;"> Thriller is a genre of literature. Thrillers are dark, engrossing, and suspenseful plot-driven stories. They very seldom include comedic elements. Any novel can generate excitement, suspense, interest, and exhilaration, but because these are the primary goals of the thriller genre, thriller writers have laser-focused expertise in keeping a reader interested.</p>'
